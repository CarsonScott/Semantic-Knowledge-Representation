# Semantic Knowledge Representation

Representations are created using sets of elements and relations with certain properties to form semantic networks.

A property is a label that describes some aspect of an element or relation. Each property has a set of possible values that it can take (e.g. a color can be red, green, blue, etc.) and takes on one of those values at any given time.
